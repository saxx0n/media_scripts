General purpose scripts to handle media

- flac_convert.py
  - I found my old iPod and decided to see if I could get it working again with a larger flash-card inside.  Turns out iPods can't handle FLAC, and most of my music was encoded as it.  This was a quick and dirty script to turn all my music into Apple lossless format which it could read.
